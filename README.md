# AI Agent with Tool Usage

It's developed following the instructions from boot.dev. The gist is somehow grasped but it's still good follow that as a guide once one needs to write something similar to that.

### Extending the Project

* Other LLM providers
* Other Gemini models
* Giving it more functions to call
* Other codebases (commit your changes before running the agent on a codebase, so you can always revert)
